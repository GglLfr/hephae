# `hephae-locale`

Hephae's localization module, integrated as assets. `LocaleCollection` maps locale codes (e.g. `en-US`, `id-ID`) to their
respective `Locale` assets, which store locale keys to their (potentially formatted) localized strings.

See `examples/text.rs` for an example joint usage of localization, text, and rendering support.
