# `hephae`

> A personalized, opinionated Bevy plugin that adds support for drawing and batching arbitrary vertices and indices.

I initially wrote this plugin as a personal measure of generalizing and expanding `bevy_sprite` into supporting
rendering arbitrary vertex attributes and indices that define such triangles, along with customizing pipelines and
render commands down to their very cores. Expanding on "personal measure," the library may feel complicated and not
concise, as it is meant to be the set of puzzle blocks your utilize to define your own 2D rendering framework.
Documentation is also fairly scarce and may not fully document caveats of the library; use at your own risk!
